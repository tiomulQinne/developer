## Diego Garcia: A History of Displacement and Conflict
 
Diego Garcia has a long and turbulent history that dates back to the early 16th century, when it was discovered by the Portuguese. The island was colonized by the French in the 18th century, who brought African slaves and Indian workers to cultivate coconut plantations. In 1814, Diego Garcia became a British colony as part of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Napoleonic Wars. The island was administered from Mauritius until 1965, when it was detached along with the rest of the Chagos Archipelago to form the British Indian Ocean Territory.
 
In 1966, the British government signed a secret agreement with the United States to allow the latter to establish a military base on Diego Garcia for 50 years, with an option to extend for another 20 years. This agreement led to the forced eviction of the island's inhabitants, who were mostly descendants of the slaves and workers brought by the French. The Chagossians, as they are known, were relocated to Mauritius and Seychelles, where they faced poverty and discrimination. Many of them have been fighting for their right to return to their homeland ever since.
 
Diego Garcia has been a strategic asset for the United States in its military operations in the Middle East and Asia. The island hosts a naval support facility, an air base, a communications station, and a satellite tracking station. It has been used as a launch pad for bombing missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria, as well as a detention and interrogation center for suspected terrorists. The island's role in the U.S.-led "War on Terror" has sparked criticism from human rights groups and regional countries, who have called for its demilitarization and decolonization.
 
In 2019, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the British government had unlawfully separated Diego Garcia from Mauritius in 1965, and that it should end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago and return it to Mauritius as soon as possible. The United Nations General Assembly endorsed this ruling and urged the United Kingdom to comply with it. However, the British government rejected the ICJ's opinion as non-binding and insisted that it had sovereignty over Diego Garcia and the rest of the archipelago. The United States also supported the British position and stated that it would continue to operate its military base on Diego Garcia until 2036.
